# Credit Card Data Analysis

This project aims to analyze and process a credit card dataset to detect potential patterns, anomalies, or fraud-related insights. The project uses a `.csv` file containing credit card transaction data and performs a series of data processing and analysis steps within a Jupyter Notebook.

## Files in the Repository

- `creditcardcsvpresent.csv`: This is the primary dataset used for analysis, containing transaction details.
- `FinalCode.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that contains all data processing and analysis code for the project.

## Installation and Requirements

This project requires the following packages:
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning, if used in the analysis (e.g., for clustering or classification).

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The `creditcardcsvpresent.csv` file contains the dataset with multiple features. Ensure the file is in the same directory as the notebook or provide the path within the code for successful data loading.

## Usage

1. Open the `FinalCode.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Execute the cells in sequence to perform the data processing, analysis, and visualizations.
3. Modify parameters as needed in each cell to explore different aspects of the dataset.

### Sections in the Notebook
- **Data Loading**: Imports the dataset into a DataFrame for processing.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, data type conversions, and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides visualizations and summaries of key data characteristics.
- **Model Training (Optional)**: If machine learning techniques are applied, this section trains and evaluates the models.
